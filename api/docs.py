#This is not an actual code. I want to use this as a form of documentation of this project.
#
#
#Actually this proj was given a week aho and i am yet to be done due to some reasons.
#
#I use a maco 10.13.6, which is a very old macos version which may cause alot of developer limitations which i have been facing for over 3 yerars now. Yh.
#
#Well, how i plan to get through this is by working with a collegue of mine to brainstorm this project so we both get to pass this stage, timing has been difficult for us recently though, but then. It's a process i know i'll get through.
#
#
#Basically, the challenge i am facing now is, i use django 5.2 and also working with mysql as the required database for this project.
#
#Installing mysql 5.7.23, the best version for my system.
#
#Django 5.2 requires a higher veriosn of mysql making me to pause my journey here. 
#
#But then i hope to get a better device soon fr so all these would stop, i hope so.
#
#for now lets wait for our amazing xit, to be ready so we brainstorm this project together and get pass hngprojsatge2 and move up to the next. i am really confident about moving higher.
#
#Backend wizards Let's gooo.
